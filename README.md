# Obstacle Avoiding Robot

car could detect if there are something in the front

## Summary

the car could detect if there is sth in the front and decide to change other way to walk

## Component Parts

arduino uno, motro shield, servo motor,ultrasonic sensor,gear motor, battery, battery pack, cable,wheels,wires, barrier(cardboard-present use) 

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 1: Write Proposal, flush out initial code for your idea
- Week 2: Make the robot, try to use code online figure out my the code and try to test whether work or not
- Week 3: Figure out how to write the code and exam the robot to see some data work good
- Week 4: Present!
 
## Challenges

As Youtube have the video teach me how to connet all the wires, therefore connet wires is not that hard.
Figure out how to write the sensor code and make it work is the hardest part.
